## **Purpose Statement**  

This dictionary is a proof of concept, tailored for maritime professionals, educators, policymakers, and the general public seeking clarity and precision in maritime terminology. While it is not exhaustive, its primary goal is to serve as a starting point for reducing risk and enhancing communication within and beyond the industry.


## **Purpose Statement**  

Dictionaries, alongside early forms of communication such as pictographs and written records, are among the oldest types of published works. Maritime vocabulary includes approximately 8,000 specialized words in the English language, in contrast to the average spoken vocabulary of most languages, which typically ranges between 15,000 and 20,000 words. Dictionaries have existed for thousands of years, originating long before the Common Era, and they remain one of the earliest forms of organized publications.

In the maritime industry, effective communication is not merely a convenience—it is a critical aspect of risk management. It is essential for both industry professionals and external stakeholders to share a clear understanding of maritime terminology. Miscommunication or misuse of language in this domain can lead to serious real-world consequences. In today’s Information Age, where global connectivity and precision are crucial, the need for a shared and accurate vocabulary has become more vital than ever.

In the 2020s, a transformative tool emerged to improve human communication: large language models (LLMs). While this technology had existed for decades, advancements in computing power enabled these models to process and generate natural human language with unprecedented accuracy. This development opened the door to new tools designed to enhance how humans interact and conduct business. This maritime dictionary leverages such tools.

This dictionary has been fine-tuned to provide domain-specific definitions for the general public. It relies on over four million words of non-copyrighted source material originating from the U.S. Government, avoiding the common practice of using copyrighted data. By combining non-copyrighted material with fine-tuning, the resource is both accurate and adaptable.

The primary purpose of this dictionary is to showcase the value of artificial intelligence in solving real-world problems while reducing risk in the maritime industry by providing precise terminology and definitions. It aims to be not only useful but also a foundation for further innovation in maritime communication.
